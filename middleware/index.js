/*
Each thing returned by an action creator - be it an action or a function - will go through our thunk middleware.

If the thunk middleware sees an action, that action will be sent to the next middleware in line - the logger middleware. If it sees a function, the thunk middleware will call that function. That function can contain side effects - such as API calls - and dispatch actions, simple Javascript objects. These dispatched actions will again go to all of the middleware. The thunk middleware will see that it’s a simple action and pass the action on to the next middleware, the logger.
